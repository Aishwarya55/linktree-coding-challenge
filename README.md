# Linktree Coding Challenge
# The Problem
We have three new link types for our users profile pages, such as https://linktr.ee/guardian

1. Classic
	- Accepts a single URL.
	- Opens the URL in a new tab.

2. Music Player 
	- On click, the link type displays a set of links to music streaming platforms where you can find the song.
	- Clicking on an element inside of the Music Link will open an audio player for that song, powered by that platform.
	- Clicking on the logo of the platform of an element will take you to that song, in that platform.

3. Shows List
	- On click, the link type displays a list of links to upcoming events.
	- Clicking on an upcoming event will navigate to the event in SongKick.
